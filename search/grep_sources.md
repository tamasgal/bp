Ag.

    ag foo /path/to/code

I formally used `ack` bug `ag` is faster and 33% shorter. Also all the keys needed to type `ag` are on the home row.

To install on OS X:

    brew install the_silver_searcher

...on Linux:

    apt-get install silversearcher-ag
    yum install the_silver_searcher
    emerge the_silver_searcher
    pacman -S the_silver_searcher
